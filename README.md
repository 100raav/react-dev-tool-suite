# 📘 React Dev Tool Suite

A **React-based Developer Tool Suite** that combines a **Code Editor**, **JavaScript Runner with User Input**, and a **Regex Tester** — all in one clean, modern interface.

This project is designed for **learning, practicing, and debugging JavaScript**, and demonstrates strong understanding of **React, async JavaScript, parsing logic, and UI/UX design**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

**React Dev Tool Suite** is a mini IDE built using React that allows users to:

* Write and analyze JavaScript code
* Execute JavaScript with real-time user input
* Test and validate complex regular expressions
* View syntax errors and AST (token-level)
* Simulate real-world coding scenarios

This project is **portfolio-ready** and suitable for **students, learners, and junior developers**.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Code Editor

* Line numbers (auto-synced)
* Auto-growing editor height
* Syntax validation (brackets & parentheses)
* Error highlighting with line & column
* Console output capture
* AST (token view) generation
* Supports async code with `await prompt()`

---

### ▶ JavaScript Runner

* Execute JavaScript logic safely
* Supports **multiple user inputs**
* Async execution (`await prompt`)
* Real-time console output
* Execution status (Running / Waiting / Completed)
* No execution timeout during user input
* Clean separation from editor logic

---

### 🔍 Regex Tester

* Input custom regex patterns
* Test against large text blocks
* Match counting & listing
* Error handling for invalid regex
* Useful for real-world validation tasks

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **React (Create React App)**
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **CSS (Custom, Dark Theme)**
* **React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)**
